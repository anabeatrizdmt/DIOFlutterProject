# dioproject

A Flutter project for the DIO course. It has a branch for each course challenge.

## Versions
### Version 1
- A simple Flutter app that keeps track of button clicks.

### Version 2
- A basic BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator that takes user input for height and weight and displays a list of calculated results.

### Version 3
- Adds a menu to navigate between the profile page and BMI records page.
- On the Profile Page, the user can set their name and email, and that information is saved using shared_preferences.
- On the BMI Records Page, there is a card to save the default height using HIVE. There is also a button to save the BMI weight and date entries to calculate the BMI and display a list. The user can delete a record by swiping to the sides. This list is saved using SQLite.
